# Expense Tracker (React & Node)

###### An experiment for learning the basics of React

##### Demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neecholaus/expense-tracker
```

```bash
cd expense-tracker
```

##### The components have already been bundled. If you make any changes, once you have all the dependencies installed, run:
```bash
npm run webpack
```

##### Finally run this to start the web server.
```bash
node server.js
```

##### Direct your browser to localhost:3000 and you can demo the app.
